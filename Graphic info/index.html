            <h2>What is the Internet?</h2>
            <p>Internet, a system architecture that has revolutionized communications and methods of commerce by
                allowing various computer networks around the world to interconnect. Sometimes referred to as a “network
                of networks,” the Internet emerged in the United States in the 1970s but did not become visible to the
                general public until the early 1990s. By 2020, approximately 4.5 billion people, or more than half of
                the world’s population, were estimated to have access to the Internet.
